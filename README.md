If there is a need to reset the database to its original state it can be done with admincredentials by doing the following steps:

- Login with the admincredentials in the login endpoint
- Copy your token
- Scroll up the page and click the autourize button
- In the field write "bearer token", token being the string you copied earlier

Important to note is that the reset database clears all users and you will have to register new users in order to log in again.
